## 🧭 1. Introduction

The Advanced Manual provides a **deep, design-oriented perspective** on Mass Image Downloader.

While the User Manual explains *how to use* the extension and the Technical User Manual explains *how it works*, this document explains **why it is designed the way it is**, what trade-offs were made, and which boundaries are intentional.

This manual is not required for daily usage.  
It exists to support **advanced understanding, long-term maintenance, and informed decision-making**.

---

### 🎯 1.1 Purpose of This Manual

The purpose of the Advanced Manual is to:

- Explain architectural and design decisions
- Make trade-offs explicit and transparent
- Document edge cases and failure modes
- Clarify intentional limitations and non-goals
- Help advanced users predict system behavior before execution

> This document favors **clarity over simplicity** and **reasoning over instructions**.

---

### 👥 1.2 Intended Audience

This manual is intended for:

- Advanced and power users
- QA engineers performing deep validation
- Maintainers and long-term contributors
- Reviewers analyzing stability and behavior
- Future maintainers revisiting design context

It assumes familiarity with:
- All features described in the User Manual
- Execution flows documented in the Technical User Manual
- Browser extension concepts (content scripts, background processes)

---

### 🧾 1.3 Version Scope and Assumptions

This document applies exclusively to:

- **Extension version:** `v2.08.149`
- **Branch:** `main`

Assumptions:
- All referenced behavior matches the released version
- No experimental or unreleased features are considered
- Deprecated logic and previous implementations are intentionally ignored

> If future versions diverge, this document must be reviewed and updated accordingly.

---

## 🧠 2. Core Design Principles

This section explains the **foundational principles** that guide the architecture and behavior of Mass Image Downloader.

These principles are not accidental; they are deliberate constraints that shape every feature and limit what the extension does — and does not do.

Understanding these principles helps explain many design decisions that may otherwise seem restrictive.

---

### 👆 2.1 Explicit User-Triggered Execution

All operations in Mass Image Downloader are **explicitly initiated by the user**.

There are no:
- Background jobs
- Automatic scans
- Scheduled tasks
- Passive listeners performing work

Every execution begins with a clear user action, such as:
- Clicking a feature in the popup
- Pressing a hotkey
- Interacting with an injected UI element

This design:
- Prevents unexpected downloads
- Avoids resource usage without user intent
- Makes behavior predictable and debuggable

> The extension never acts autonomously.

---

### 🧩 2.2 Atomic, Isolated Feature Design

Each feature is designed as an **atomic execution unit**.

This means:
- Features do not depend on the internal state of other features
- Temporary state is not shared across executions
- Failures in one feature do not corrupt others

Examples:
- Bulk Image Download does not reuse gallery state
- Image Inspector runs independently of batch logic
- One-click Download Icon does not inherit gallery limits

Atomicity improves:
- Reliability
- Debuggability
- Long-term maintainability

---

### 🚫 2.3 No Background Polling or Persistent Jobs

Mass Image Downloader intentionally avoids:
- Background polling
- Long-lived timers
- Persistent asynchronous jobs

Reasons:
- Browser extensions have strict lifecycle constraints
- Persistent jobs increase memory usage and instability
- Silent background behavior violates user expectations

> All background activity exists **only during active execution** and is terminated immediately afterward.

---

### 🔐 2.4 Privacy-by-Design and Minimal Persistence

Privacy is enforced through **absence of storage**, not policy.

Key rules:
- No download history is stored
- No page URLs are persisted
- No behavioral profiling exists
- No execution metrics are retained

Only user configuration is persisted.

This ensures:
- Zero long-term tracking
- No data accumulation over time
- Predictable, stateless behavior

> The extension treats each execution as disposable and isolated.
