## 🧭 1. Introduction

The Advanced Manual provides a **deep, design-oriented perspective** on Mass Image Downloader.

While the User Manual explains *how to use* the extension and the Technical User Manual explains *how it works*, this document explains **why it is designed the way it is**, what trade-offs were made, and which boundaries are intentional.

This manual is not required for daily usage.  
It exists to support **advanced understanding, long-term maintenance, and informed decision-making**.

---

### 🎯 1.1 Purpose of This Manual

The purpose of the Advanced Manual is to:

- Explain architectural and design decisions
- Make trade-offs explicit and transparent
- Document edge cases and failure modes
- Clarify intentional limitations and non-goals
- Help advanced users predict system behavior before execution

> This document favors **clarity over simplicity** and **reasoning over instructions**.

---

### 👥 1.2 Intended Audience

This manual is intended for:

- Advanced and power users
- QA engineers performing deep validation
- Maintainers and long-term contributors
- Reviewers analyzing stability and behavior
- Future maintainers revisiting design context

It assumes familiarity with:
- All features described in the User Manual
- Execution flows documented in the Technical User Manual
- Browser extension concepts (content scripts, background processes)

---

### 🧾 1.3 Version Scope and Assumptions

This document applies exclusively to:

- **Extension version:** `v2.08.149`
- **Branch:** `main`

Assumptions:
- All referenced behavior matches the released version
- No experimental or unreleased features are considered
- Deprecated logic and previous implementations are intentionally ignored

> If future versions diverge, this document must be reviewed and updated accordingly.

---

## 🧠 2. Core Design Principles

This section explains the **foundational principles** that guide the architecture and behavior of Mass Image Downloader.

These principles are not accidental; they are deliberate constraints that shape every feature and limit what the extension does — and does not do.

Understanding these principles helps explain many design decisions that may otherwise seem restrictive.

---

### 👆 2.1 Explicit User-Triggered Execution

All operations in Mass Image Downloader are **explicitly initiated by the user**.

There are no:
- Background jobs
- Automatic scans
- Scheduled tasks
- Passive listeners performing work

Every execution begins with a clear user action, such as:
- Clicking a feature in the popup
- Pressing a hotkey
- Interacting with an injected UI element

This design:
- Prevents unexpected downloads
- Avoids resource usage without user intent
- Makes behavior predictable and debuggable

> The extension never acts autonomously.

---

### 🧩 2.2 Atomic, Isolated Feature Design

Each feature is designed as an **atomic execution unit**.

This means:
- Features do not depend on the internal state of other features
- Temporary state is not shared across executions
- Failures in one feature do not corrupt others

Examples:
- Bulk Image Download does not reuse gallery state
- Image Inspector runs independently of batch logic
- One-click Download Icon does not inherit gallery limits

Atomicity improves:
- Reliability
- Debuggability
- Long-term maintainability

---

### 🚫 2.3 No Background Polling or Persistent Jobs

Mass Image Downloader intentionally avoids:
- Background polling
- Long-lived timers
- Persistent asynchronous jobs

Reasons:
- Browser extensions have strict lifecycle constraints
- Persistent jobs increase memory usage and instability
- Silent background behavior violates user expectations

> All background activity exists **only during active execution** and is terminated immediately afterward.

---

### 🔐 2.4 Privacy-by-Design and Minimal Persistence

Privacy is enforced through **absence of storage**, not policy.

Key rules:
- No download history is stored
- No page URLs are persisted
- No behavioral profiling exists
- No execution metrics are retained

Only user configuration is persisted.

This ensures:
- Zero long-term tracking
- No data accumulation over time
- Predictable, stateless behavior

> The extension treats each execution as disposable and isolated.

---

## ⚖️ 3. Trade-offs and Engineering Decisions

Every feature in Mass Image Downloader reflects **explicit engineering trade-offs**.

This section makes those trade-offs visible, explaining why certain choices were favored and what is intentionally sacrificed as a result.

There are no “free” decisions — each gain comes with a cost.

---

### 🚀 3.1 Speed vs Accuracy

One of the most visible trade-offs is between **execution speed** and **image selection accuracy**.

Faster configurations:
- Use lower similarity thresholds
- Allow smaller image sizes
- Favor direct URL extraction

More accurate configurations:
- Enforce stricter size thresholds
- Use similarity grouping
- Limit batch size and concurrency

Design choice:
- The system defaults favor **accuracy over speed**
- Speed can be increased deliberately by relaxing constraints

> This prevents accidental over-download of low-value or decorative images.

---

### 🧵 3.2 Concurrency vs Stability

Concurrency improves throughput but directly impacts browser stability.

High concurrency:
- Opens more tabs simultaneously
- Increases memory and CPU usage
- Risks site throttling or crashes

Low concurrency:
- Reduces system pressure
- Improves predictability
- Increases total execution time

Design choice:
- Concurrency is always bounded
- There is no “unlimited” mode
- Rate limiting complements concurrency to smooth execution

> Stability is prioritized over raw performance.

---

### 🧠 3.3 Automation vs Manual Control

The extension deliberately offers **both automated and manual flows**.

Automated flows:
- Bulk Image Download
- Gallery extraction modes

Manual flows:
- Image Inspector
- One-click Download Icon

Design choice:
- Automation handles common, repeatable patterns
- Manual tools exist for precision and verification

> This avoids forcing automation in scenarios where human judgment is required.

---

### 📊 3.4 Global Rules vs Feature-Specific Rules

Global rules simplify consistency but reduce flexibility.

Examples of global rules:
- Minimum image size
- Allowed formats
- Filename conventions

Feature-specific rules:
- Gallery similarity thresholds
- Web-linked gallery concurrency
- Bulk batch limits

Design choice:
- Global rules define a baseline contract
- Feature-specific rules refine behavior locally

> This balance prevents configuration explosion while preserving control.

---

## 🔗 4. Cross-Feature Interactions

Although features in Mass Image Downloader are designed to be atomic, they are **not isolated in perception**.

Some elements intentionally act as **shared signals** or **shared references**, allowing users to understand system state across different execution modes.

This section explains how features interact indirectly and what assumptions can safely be made.

---

### 🏷️ 4.1 Badge State as a Shared Signal

The extension badge acts as a **global execution indicator**.

Key characteristics:
- Badge state reflects the **current active execution**, not a specific feature
- Only one execution flow is active at a time
- Badge color and counter are reset at the start of each operation

Implications:
- Badge behavior is consistent across features
- Users can rely on badge color to infer system state
- Feature-specific details are intentionally abstracted away

Design choice:
- The badge communicates *status*, not *context*
- Detailed context belongs in logs or Peek

---

### 🔎 4.2 Peek as the Runtime Source of Truth

The Peek panel is the **authoritative view of effective configuration** at runtime.

Important properties:
- Peek reflects settings as loaded by the background layer
- It does not display unsaved UI state
- It updates dynamically when settings change

Cross-feature relevance:
- All features consume the same global configuration snapshot
- Peek provides a single point of verification regardless of feature used

Design choice:
- One runtime truth prevents configuration ambiguity
- Peek is informational, not interactive

---

### ⚙️ 4.3 Global Settings Impact Across Features

Some settings intentionally affect **multiple features simultaneously**.

Examples:
- Minimum image size applies to all extraction modes
- Allowed formats affect every download path
- Filename rules are enforced globally

Consequences:
- Changing a global setting may alter behavior in unexpected places
- Feature-level tuning must respect global constraints

Design choice:
- Shared rules enforce consistency
- Users must reason globally, not per feature

---

### 🧠 4.4 Temporary State Reuse and Isolation

Temporary state is **execution-scoped**, not feature-scoped.

Rules:
- State exists only during a single execution
- No state survives between executions
- State is not reused across features

This ensures:
- Predictable behavior
- No hidden coupling between features
- Clean restarts for every action

Design choice:
- Isolation over convenience
- Repeatability over optimization
