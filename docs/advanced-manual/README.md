## 🧭 1. Introduction

The Advanced Manual provides a **deep, design-oriented perspective** on Mass Image Downloader.

While the User Manual explains *how to use* the extension and the Technical User Manual explains *how it works*, this document explains **why it is designed the way it is**, what trade-offs were made, and which boundaries are intentional.

This manual is not required for daily usage.  
It exists to support **advanced understanding, long-term maintenance, and informed decision-making**.

---

### 🎯 1.1 Purpose of This Manual

The purpose of the Advanced Manual is to:

- Explain architectural and design decisions
- Make trade-offs explicit and transparent
- Document edge cases and failure modes
- Clarify intentional limitations and non-goals
- Help advanced users predict system behavior before execution

> This document favors **clarity over simplicity** and **reasoning over instructions**.

---

### 👥 1.2 Intended Audience

This manual is intended for:

- Advanced and power users
- QA engineers performing deep validation
- Maintainers and long-term contributors
- Reviewers analyzing stability and behavior
- Future maintainers revisiting design context

It assumes familiarity with:
- All features described in the User Manual
- Execution flows documented in the Technical User Manual
- Browser extension concepts (content scripts, background processes)

---

### 🧾 1.3 Version Scope and Assumptions

This document applies exclusively to:

- **Extension version:** `v2.08.149`
- **Branch:** `main`

Assumptions:
- All referenced behavior matches the released version
- No experimental or unreleased features are considered
- Deprecated logic and previous implementations are intentionally ignored

> If future versions diverge, this document must be reviewed and updated accordingly.
