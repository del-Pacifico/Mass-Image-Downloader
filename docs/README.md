## 🧭 How the Documentation Is Organized

The documentation is intentionally split into **independent manuals**, each answering a different question:

- *How do I use it?*
- *How do I configure it?*
- *How does it work internally?*
- *Why was it designed this way?*

Each document is self-contained and avoids overlap.
