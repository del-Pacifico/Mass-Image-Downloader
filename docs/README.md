## 🧭 How the Documentation Is Organized

The documentation is intentionally split into **independent manuals**, each answering a different question:

- *How do I use it?*
- *How do I configure it?*
- *How does it work internally?*
- *Why was it designed this way?*

Each document is self-contained and avoids overlap.

### 💡 Ideas & Early Proposals

- **Location:** GitHub Discussions

- Discussions are exploratory and **do not represent commitments**.

> Ideas may be promoted to Issues once they are clear and actionable.

### 🗂️ Development Backlog

- **Location:** GitHub Issues
- The backlog consists of Issues labeled with:
  - `type:*` (classification)
  - optional `priority:*`
  - and without a final resolution status

> Issues represent **actionable work** that can be scheduled and implemented.

---

### 🚧 Work in Progress
