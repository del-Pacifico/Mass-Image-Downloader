# Mass Image Downloader

## 🌐 Overview

Mass Image Downloader is a Chromium (MV3) extension that helps you **collect and download images at scale**—from single pages, multi-page galleries, or across open tabs—while keeping results high-quality and reproducible.

### Core goals

- ⚡ **Speed** with control: bulk/tab scanning, gallery extractors (direct/visual/web-linked), and manual one-click saving.
- 👌 **Quality** by design: filters for minimum size, allowed formats (PNG, JPG/JPEG, WEBP, AVIF, BMP), and path-similarity grouping to reduce duplicates.
- 👨‍🔬 **Reproducibility**: deterministic file naming (prefix/suffix/timestamp) and optional clipboard hotkeys for dataset labeling.
- 💪 **Stability**: pacing (max images per second), per-gallery caps, batching under MV3, and clear visual feedback (badge: green/yellow/blue).

### Who it’s for

- Power users, researchers, curators, QA teams, and dataset builders who need **reliable bulk image workflows** with fine-grained controls.

### Environment

- Chromium-based browsers: Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave  
- Minimum Chromium version: **93+** · Manifest: **V3**

> Full breakdown of options is available in the **Options Page** of the extension.

Includes:

- 📁 Download folder (default or custom)
- 🖼️ Allowed image formats
- 📐 Minimum width & height filters
- ✍️ Filename mode (prefix, suffix, timestamp)
- 📋 Clipboard hotkeys (Ctrl+Alt+P / S)
- 💬 Visual feedback toggle
- 🧠 Smart grouping and fallback logic
- ⚡ Rate limit for gallery processing
- 🔢 Batch size and concurrency controls
- 🔍 Debug log level (0–3)

- Introduced a **fully standardized toast notification system** across the extension.

- Added a new configurable option:
  - **Toast Minimum Visible Time (ms)**

- Normalized user feedback messages under the `MID:` format and removed emoji-based UI noise from user-facing toasts.

- Improved toast timing behavior to prevent overlapping messages during rapid workflows.

- Stabilized feedback flows for:
  - Bulk Download
  - Gallery (direct links)
  - Gallery (visual / no links)
  - Gallery (web-linked)
  - One-click download icon
  - Image Inspector

## ✨ Features

- 🔢 **Multiple extraction modes**
  - **Bulk Image Download** — scan open tabs and collect valid image URLs with global filters and batching.
  - **Galleries (with direct links)** — thumbnails anchor directly to media files (fastest path).
  - **Galleries (without links)** — large images are displayed inline; the extractor filters by size/format.
  - **Web-linked galleries** — thumbnails lead to HTML detail pages; the extractor opens them with bounded fan-out and picks the best image.

- 🎯 **Gallery Image Handling (immediate/tab)**
  - **Download immediately** — saves the resolved image without intermediate UI.
  - **Open in new tab before downloading** — opens each target in a background tab for manual verification, then you can save.
  > Choose “tab” when sites render the final image only after JS or when you want to visually confirm the target.

- 🖐️ **Manual download overlay (hotkey)**
  - **Alt+Shift+I** — toggles a small **download icon** over the focused image; click to save instantly (no popup).
  > Ideal for curation: review the page visually and cherry-pick just a handful of items.

- 📋 **Clipboard labeling (hotkeys)**
  - **Ctrl+Alt+P** — set **filename prefix** from clipboard.  
  - **Ctrl+Alt+S** — set **filename suffix** from clipboard.
  > Great for dataset runs: copy a label/tag once and apply it to all subsequent files.

- 🕵️ **Image Inspector Mode (hover + side panel)**
  - **Ctrl+Shift+M** — toggles Inspector Mode. Hover displays a small 🕵️ overlay; clicking opens a right-docked panel with:
    - Safe preview with zoom (✚ / – / ⛶) and drag-to-pan
    - Visible metadata (dimensions, title, alt, URLs)
    - Optional Developer Mode with technical details
    - Save workflow with close-on-save (optional)
    - Navigation arrows (⬅️ / ➡️) to browse all images on the current page
  > Perfect for single-image review, debugging, and high-precision workflows.

- 📶 **Throughput & pacing for galleries**
  - **Max images per second** — smooths extraction on heavy pages to avoid site throttling and CPU spikes.
  > Start with 2–3 and increase gradually. If a site is strict, lower it.

- 🔄️ **Concurrency (open-tab fan-out)**
  - **Max open tabs per gallery** (download concurrency limit) — caps how many background tabs are opened simultaneously in “tab” mode.
  > Keeps memory predictable and avoids a “tab storm” while still parallelizing work.

- 🎰 **Similarity & per-gallery bounding**
  - **Path-similarity threshold** — clusters related variants and cuts duplicates/resized copies.
  - **Max images per gallery** — limits how many items each gallery contributes.
  > Clean grouping first; downloading then deleting is slower and noisier.

- 📑 **Resume bulk sessions**
  - **Continue from where it left off** — resumes the next bulk batch from the last processed tab/page.
  > Useful for long multi-tab sessions or when you paused mid-way.

- 📝 **Deterministic file-naming**
  - Modes: **none / prefix / suffix / both / timestamp**.
  - Enforced via `downloads.onDeterminingFilename` to keep names stable and reproducible.

- 📌 **Dimension & format filters**
  - **Minimum width & height** — both must be met to qualify.
  - **Allowed formats** — enable only what you want processed.
  > If expected images are skipped, check real pixel sizes in DevTools (CSS can scale visuals).

- 💬 **User feedback & diagnostics**
  - **Badge states** — Green (bulk), Yellow (manual), Blue (done) for quick progress cues.
  - **Notifications / Toasts** — optional in-page messages for success/errors.
  - **Debug log levels (0–3)** — from silent to detailed traces, all prefixed with `[Mass image downloader]:`.

---

## 🔔 User Notifications

Mass Image Downloader uses a lightweight in-page toast notification system to provide consistent feedback during downloads, extraction flows, and read-only UI actions.

All operational notifications now follow a unified `MID:` standard.

### Standard Message Pattern

The extension uses a consistent 3-step structure for long-running workflows:

- `MID: <Functionality> started. Scanning...`
- `MID: <Functionality>: found N image(s). Downloading...`
- `MID: <Functionality> completed. Downloaded: N`

Depending on the workflow, the second or third message may use wording such as:

- **Sending...**
- **Opening...**
- or **Sent: N**

When downloads are handled by the background layer or when tabs are opened instead of files being saved directly.

### Toast Minimum Visible Time

A new option is available in:

- **Options → Notifications**

> Toast Minimum Visible Time (ms)

**Default value**:

> 2000

This setting defines the minimum amount of time a toast remains visible before another toast can replace it.

#### **Notification Behavior**

The toast engine follows these rules:

- only one toast is visible at a time
- user messages are prefixed with MID:
- emoji usage was removed from user-facing toasts
- fast flows defer replacement until the minimum visible time expires
- the latest pending toast replaces the previous one once the delay window is over

This keeps feedback readable and prevents visual spam during rapid workflows such as Bulk Download or Gallery extraction.

## 🧩 Installation (Developer Mode / Unpacked)

This repository can be loaded **unpacked** and is **fully operational**—ideal for debugging, forking, and submitting pull requests.

### Steps (Chrome / Edge / Brave)

1) Open `chrome://extensions/` (or `edge://extensions/`, `brave://extensions/`).  
2) Enable **Developer mode** (top-right toggle).  
3) Click **Load unpacked** and select the project folder (the one containing `manifest.json`).  
4) Pin the extension icon to the toolbar for quick access and visible badge states.

> The **unpacked** build runs the same core code paths as a packaged release, so you can reproduce issues and verify fixes before opening a PR.

### Notes

- **Permissions prompts**: the extension requests only the MV3 APIs needed for its features (tabs, downloads, storage, scripting, clipboardRead).  
- **Enterprise restrictions**: managed environments may limit the Downloads API or filename handling—check your admin policies.  
- **Chrome Web Store**: a store release is planned; for now, Developer Mode is the recommended way to use and test the extension.

---

## 🧩 How it works

Mass Image Downloader adapts to different page structures. You can either **download immediately** or **open targets in background tabs** (to verify visually before saving). The badge shows progress in real time: **green** (bulk in progress), **yellow** (manual in progress), **blue** (done).

### 1) 📸 Bulk Image Download

- **Scope:** scans your open tabs (configurable direction/scope) and collects valid image URLs.
- **Pipeline:** read settings → discover candidates → validate (size/format/URL) → build deterministic filenames → download in batches → audit completion.
- **Resume runs:** if enabled, **Continue from where it left off** restarts the next batch from the last processed tab.
- **Why it’s fast:** no DOM scraping per se; it works from tab URLs and direct media targets.

### 2) 🌄 Galleries (with direct links)

- **Structure:** thumbnails wrapped by anchors pointing **directly** to media files  
  `(<a href="*.jpg|png|webp|avif|bmp"><img ...></a>)`.
- **Behavior:** picks the best valid target per item (usually the full-size link), applies filters, and downloads.
- **Immediate vs Tab mode:**
  - **Immediate download:** fastest path; saves directly.
  - **Open in tabs first:** opens each target in a background tab, so you can confirm it’s truly the high-res image before saving.

### 3) 🖼️ Galleries (without links)

- **Structure:** large images are shown **inline** as `<img>`; no dedicated link page.
- **Behavior:** collects visible `<img>` that meet **both** min width/height and allowed formats; optional grouping by path similarity reduces duplicates/resized variants.
- **Throughput:** governed by **Max images per second** to avoid CPU/network spikes.

### 4) 🔗 Web-linked galleries

- **Structure:** thumbnails link to **HTML pages** (not directly to media) like  
  `(<a href="/detail/123.html"><img ...></a>)`.
- **Behavior:** opens each detail page with **bounded fan-out** and extracts the best valid image found inside.
- **Controls for stability:**
  - **Max open tabs per gallery:** caps simultaneous background tabs to avoid a “tab storm”.
  - **Delay between tab openings (ms):** spreads out the fan-out to be kinder to the site and your CPU.
  - **Max images per second:** throttles extraction pace.

### Manual & hotkey workflows

- **Alt+Shift+I** — toggles a small **download icon** (💾) over the focused image; click to save instantly (no popup).
- **Ctrl+Alt+P / Ctrl+Alt+S** — set filename **prefix/suffix** from the clipboard for quick, consistent labeling across a batch.

> Tip: For curation, combine **prefix/suffix** labels with **Alt+Shift+I** and save only the images you want.

### Image Inspector Mode (🕵️)

- **Ctrl+Shift+M** toggles Inspector Mode on/off.
- Hovering an eligible image displays a small 🕵️ overlay in the top-left corner.
- Clicking the overlay opens a right-docked panel built with a Shadow DOM host.
- The panel includes:
  - Safe preview with zoom controls (✚ / – / ⛶)  
  - Drag-to-pan when zoomed  
  - Visible metadata (dimensions, alt, title, URLs)  
  - Optional Developer Mode (node type, full URL, debug metadata)  
  - Navigation arrows (⬅️ / ➡️) to browse all images on the current page  
  - Save workflow that integrates with global naming, folders and conflict rules
- Inspector controls (🕵️ ✖ ✚ – ⛶ ⬅️ ➡️ 🔗 💾) share the same hover/active styling as the one-click download icon: a light neutral background, a clear highlight on hover, and inline tooltips that disappear as soon as the cursor leaves.
- When **Close page after saving** is enabled, the current tab closes automatically after a successful Inspector-initiated download.

### Peek Settings (view-only UI)

Peek Settings lets you preview all option values without altering them.
Useful when debugging a failing extraction or validating global rules.

### Grouping & bounding (why it matters)

- **Path similarity threshold:** clusters “near-duplicate” URLs so resized/cached variants don’t flood your dataset.
- **Max images per gallery:** prevents a single gallery from dominating the run and keeps memory predictable.

### Why pacing exists (and how to tune it)

- **Max images per second** protects you from server-side throttling and transient blocks on strict sites.
- **Max open tabs per gallery + Delay between tab openings** control how aggressively “tab mode” fans out.

> Start conservative (e.g., 2–3 images/sec, a small tab cap, and a short delay), then ramp up as you verify stability.

### Quick self-tests (no special toggles required)

- **🖼 Test image thresholds:** open DevTools → inspect candidate images → check **naturalWidth/Height**; adjust min size until you see the expected items accepted/skipped.
- **🧬 “Simulate” extraction failures (for diagnosis):** temporarily **raise** min dimensions or **disable** a format to force skips; observe logs at level 1–2 to confirm the reason (size/format/URL). Restore normal values afterward.

## 🧭 Behavior on tab navigation & page close

Different modes have different resilience when you switch tabs, navigate away, or close pages during a run. Use this matrix to decide when it’s safe to multitask.

| Mode | Safe on tab switch? | Safe on page close? | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Bulk Image Download** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Runs from the background; progress continues while you browse elsewhere. Works best with “Continue from where it left off” for long sessions. |
| **Galleries (with direct links)** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Targets direct media URLs; resilient to focus changes. Immediate-download mode is fully background-safe. |
| **Galleries (without links)** | ⚠️ Partial | ❌ No | Relies on the current DOM. Navigating away or closing the page can interrupt discovery/validation of `<img>` elements. Prefer to keep the tab visible until the badge turns **blue**. |
| **Web-linked galleries** | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Partial | Opens detail pages in background tabs with bounded fan-out. If you close those background tabs early, extraction for those items is canceled. Use **Max open tabs per gallery** and **Delay between tab openings** to keep it stable. |

### 👉 Practical guidance

- **Prefer “Open in tabs first”** when sites render the final image only after client-side scripts, or when you want to **visually confirm** each target before saving.
- **For long runs (bulk)** enable **Continue from where it left off** so subsequent runs resume from the last processed tab/page.
- **Tune pacing** for “tab” mode using:
  - **Max open tabs per gallery** — limits concurrent background tabs to prevent a tab storm.
  - **Delay between tab openings (ms)** — spreads fan-out to be gentler on the site and your CPU.
  - **Max images per second** — throttles extractor rate to avoid server-side rate limits.
- **Inspector-specific tip:** finish or cancel any in-panel saves before closing or navigating the tab; the panel is page-bound, but once a save is dispatched, the download pipeline is fully background-driven.
- **Watch the badge**:  
  - **Green** (white numbers) → bulk in progress  
  - **Yellow** → manual in progress (e.g., Alt+Shift+I overlay flow)  
  - **Blue** → all done (safe to close everything)

## 🛠️ Extension Options

All settings are stored in `chrome.storage.sync` and applied across flows. This section lists every configurable control and explains *why* it exists.

### 🌍 Global Settings

This section describes global options that affect how the extension discovers, filters, names, and saves images across all modes.

#### 📁 File system

Controls where files are saved, which formats are accepted, whether extended URLs are valid, and how filenames are constructed.

- **Choose Download Folder** (Default system folder / Custom folder)  
  Select where files are saved. “Custom” defines a subfolder under your default Downloads directory to keep datasets organized per project.  
  Applies to: All modes.  
  **Notes:** Disable the browser prompt “Ask where to save each file before downloading” for uninterrupted bulk runs.

- **Allowed Image Formats** (JPG, JPEG, PNG, WEBP, AVIF, BMP)  
  Toggle which formats are accepted. Skips unwanted or non-decodable assets early for faster, cleaner results.  
  Applies to: All modes.  
  **Notes:** AVIF/BMP depend on browser support; if items are skipped, verify decoding capability and toggles.

- **Allow extended image URLs** (accept Twitter/X `:large`, `:orig`, etc. as valid images)  
  Accept platform-specific suffix variants as valid image URLs so you can capture higher-resolution versions when available.  
  Applies to: All modes.  
  **Notes:** This does not upscale images; it only accepts variant links when the site provides them.

- **Filename Customization** (Mode: none / prefix / suffix / both / timestamp; with Prefix/Suffix inputs)  
  Build deterministic, reproducible filenames. Use prefix/suffix for labeled batches or timestamp to avoid collisions.  
  Applies to: All modes.  
  **Notes:** Keep names filesystem-safe (avoid slashes, wildcards, control characters).

#### 📋 Clipboard Hotkeys

Enables quick, consistent labeling of files by setting prefix/suffix from the clipboard.

- **Enable clipboard shortcuts for prefix/suffix**  
  Set naming labels from the clipboard using keyboard shortcuts—copy once, apply across the batch.  
  Applies to: All modes (naming only).  
  Hotkeys: `Ctrl + Alt + P` → set **Prefix**, `Ctrl + Alt + S` → set **Suffix**  
  **Notes:** Requires this toggle enabled; operates in the active tab context.

#### 🕵️ Image Inspector

Controls how **Image Inspector Mode** behaves when inspecting and saving images from the side panel.

- **Enable Image Inspector Mode**  
  Turns the **Ctrl + Shift + M** shortcut on or off. When disabled, Inspector Mode cannot be activated and no hover overlay or panel is injected.  
  Applies to: Image Inspector Mode only.  
  **Notes:** Recommended to keep enabled if you routinely debug image metadata or need high-precision single-image review.

- **Developer Mode**  
  Adds an extra “developer” section inside the inspector panel with technical details such as normalized URL, detected format, and debug hints.  
  Applies to: Image Inspector Mode only.  
  **Notes:** Ideal for QA, contributors, or advanced users who want to understand why some images are skipped or how rules are applied.

- **Close page after saving image**  
  If enabled, the current tab is closed automatically after a successful save triggered from Image Inspector Mode.  
  Applies to: Image Inspector Mode only.  
  **Notes:** This is separate from panel close behavior; the panel itself can still be closed manually even when this toggle is off.

### 🖱️ One-click Download Icon

Provides a manual, no-popup workflow to save the focused image instantly via hotkey.

- **Enable One-click download icon (via hotkey)**  
  Toggle a small overlay on the focused image and save instantly—no popup needed; perfect for manual curation.  
  Applies to: Any page with valid images (manual/curation workflows).  
  Hotkey: `Alt + Shift + I`  
  **Notes:** Respects your size/format rules; ideal when cherry-picking an image from a page.

#### 🖼️ Galleries

Global options that shape how gallery extractors group, select, and pace items.

- **Gallery Similarity Level (%)**  
  Set the path-based similarity threshold to cluster related items and reduce duplicates/resized variants.  
  Applies to: Gallery extractors (with/without links).  
  **Notes:** Raise to group more aggressively (fewer duplicates); lower if legitimate variants are being split.

- **Minimum Group Size**  
  Define how many items a cluster must have to count as a valid gallery. Prevents noise from tiny or accidental groups.  
  Applies to: Gallery extractors.

- **Enable smart similarity grouping**  
  Turn on heuristic grouping to handle real-world, messy URL patterns more robustly.  
  Applies to: Gallery extractors.  
  **Notes:** Works as a first-pass strategy before selection.

- **Enable fallback grouping**  
  Run a secondary, more permissive grouping when no dominant pattern is found. Helps salvage legitimate sets on tricky sites.  
  Applies to: Gallery extractors.

- **Gallery Image Handling** (Download immediately / Open in new tab before downloading)  
  Choose how to process each selected target after grouping. “Immediate” is fastest; “Open in new tab” lets you visually confirm before saving.  
  Applies to: Gallery extractors.  
  **Notes:** Use tab mode when pages render the final image only after client-side scripts.

- **Max images per second**  
  Throttle the gallery extractor pace to avoid site-side rate limits and CPU spikes.  
  Applies to: Gallery extractors (with/without links, immediate or tab mode).  
  **Notes:** Start with 2–3 and increase gradually; reduce if a site is strict.

##### 📐 Image size

Size thresholds to exclude assets that are too small for your use case.

- **Minimum Image Width (px)**  
  Reject images below this width.  
  Applies to: All modes.

- **Minimum Image Height (px)**  
  Reject images below this height.  
  Applies to: All modes.  
  **Notes:** Both dimensions must be met. Check `naturalWidth/Height` in DevTools—CSS can scale visuals without changing bitmap size.

### 📢 Notifications

Controls in-page toasts and the visibility of the read-only Peek overlay.

- **Show user feedback messages**  
  Display lightweight in-page toasts for success/progress/errors during runs.  
  Applies to: All modes.  
  **Notes:** Turn off for headless-style bulk sessions; turn on while calibrating filters.

- **Peek panel transparency (0.2 – 1.0)**  
  Control the opacity of the read-only **Peek** overlay to keep the page visible underneath.  
  Applies to: Peek Settings Mode (UI only).  
  **Notes:** Typical comfortable values: 0.7–0.9.

- **Toast Minimum Visible Time (ms)**  
  Defines the minimum time a toast notification remains visible before another notification can replace it.  
  Applies to: All user-facing toast flows.  
  **Default:** `2000 ms`  
  **Notes:** Useful for rapid workflows where multiple events happen back-to-back. Prevents toast overlap and improves readability.

### 🐛 Debugging

Adjusts logging verbosity to diagnose filtering, grouping, and download behaviors.

- **Console log level**  
  Control verbosity of console logs: 0 (silent), 1 (basic, recommended), 2 (verbose), 3 (detailed).  
  Applies to: All modes.  
  **Notes:** More logs = more overhead. Use 0–1 daily; raise to 2–3 only for troubleshooting. Logs are prefixed with `[Mass image downloader]:`.

### 📸 Download images directly in tabs Settings

Options that only affect the **Download images directly in tabs** flow (bulk across tabs with batching).

- **Max images per batch**  
  Define how many images are processed per batch to keep the MV3 Service Worker responsive and memory stable.  
  Applies to: Download images directly in tabs.  
  **Notes:** Larger batches finish faster but can be heavier; tune to your system.

- **Continue from where it left off**  
  Resume the next bulk batch from the last processed tab/page.  
  Applies to: Download images directly in tabs.  
  **Notes:** Useful for very long multi-tab sessions or when you need to pause mid-run.

### 🔗 Web-Linked Gallery Settings

Options that only affect the **Extract Web-Linked Galleries** flow (thumbnails link to HTML detail pages).

- **Max open tabs per gallery**  
  Cap how many detail pages open concurrently to prevent tab storms.  
  Applies to: Web-linked galleries (tab mode).  
  **Notes:** Typical balanced values are around 4–6 concurrent tabs.

- **Delay between tab openings (ms)**  
  Add spacing between opening new tabs so strict sites are less likely to throttle or soft-block you.  
  Applies to: Web-linked galleries (tab mode).  
  **Notes:** A starting point of ~300–800 ms works well; increase if the site is sensitive.

### ⚙️ Performance Presets

One-click profiles that auto-configure multiple options for your machine and target sites.

- **Low Spec Configuration**  
  Conservative settings for older hardware or very strict sites: lower images/sec, smaller batches, fewer concurrent tabs, higher similarity, and higher minimum size.  
  Applies to: Auto-configures multiple options at once.

- **Medium Spec Configuration**  
  Balanced defaults for most machines and pages: moderate images/sec and batch sizes, smart grouping enabled, broad formats.  
  Applies to: Auto-configures multiple options at once.

- **High Spec Configuration**  
  Aggressive throughput for powerful machines: higher images/sec, larger batches, more concurrent tabs, permissive fallback grouping, shorter tab delays.  
  Applies to: Auto-configures multiple options at once.

- **Custom (auto-set)**  
  Automatically selected when you tweak any setting after choosing a preset, reflecting your bespoke configuration.  
  Applies to: Preset status only.  
  **Notes:** Not directly selectable; it appears once you diverge from a preset.

### 🔧 Default Values

Unless changed in the Options page, these defaults apply globally:

- **Minimum Image Dimensions:** width = 800, height = 600  
- **Allowed Formats:** JPG, JPEG, PNG (WEBP, AVIF, BMP disabled by default)  
- **Download Limit (simultaneous):** 1  
- **Max Images Per Batch (Bulk Download):** 0 (unlimited)  
- **Extract Gallery Mode:** `tab`  
- **Gallery Max Images (per second):** 3  
- **Gallery Similarity Level:** 70%  
- **Gallery Minimum Group Size:** 3  
- **Filename Mode:** none (prefix/suffix empty)  
- **User Feedback Messages:** disabled  

> Note: Both width and height thresholds must be met. Some flows (Bulk vs Gallery) apply these defaults slightly differently, but the global values remain consistent.

---

## 🚀 Usage (Quick Start)

### 1) Install & pin the toolbar icon

- Load the extension in **Developer Mode** (unpacked) and pin the icon so the badge (green/yellow/blue) is always visible.

### 2) Open the popup & choose a mode

- Pick the flow that matches the page structure:
  - **Bulk Image Download** — scan open tabs with global filters and batching.
  - **Galleries (with direct links)** — thumbnails link directly to media files.
  - **Galleries (without links)** — large images are inline `<img>` elements.
  - **Web-linked galleries** — thumbnails lead to **HTML detail pages**.

> Tip: If “with direct links” finds little, try **Web-linked galleries**.

### 3) Configure once (Options)

- **File system:** folder, allowed formats, extended URLs, filename mode (prefix/suffix/timestamp).
- **Galleries:** similarity level, min group size, smart/fallback grouping, **image handling** (immediate/tab), **max images per second**.
- **Image size:** minimum width/height (both must be met).
- **Notifications & Debug:** toasts on/off, log level 0–3.
- **Web-linked:** limit **max open tabs per gallery** and set **delay between openings** (ms).
- **Bulk tabs flow:** set **max images per batch** and **continue from where it left off**.

> Use **Peek Settings** before long runs to verify active thresholds and pacing.

### 4) Run the flow

- Navigate to a page (or a set of tabs), start the chosen mode, and watch the badge:
  - **Green** (white numbers) → bulk in progress
  - **Yellow** → manual/curation in progress
  - **Blue** → all done

### 5) Manual & hotkeys (curation)

- **Alt + Shift + I** — toggle the **one-click download icon** over the focused image and save instantly (no popup).
- **Ctrl + Shift + M** — toggle **Image Inspector Mode**; hover an image to see the 🕵️ overlay and click it to open the side panel with zoom, metadata, and navigation.
- **Ctrl + Alt + P / S** — set **filename prefix / suffix** from the clipboard to label a batch.

> Perfect for cherry-picking a few images while keeping names consistent.

### 6) Throughput & stability

- Start conservative: **2–3 images/sec**, modest **max open tabs**, short **tab-open delay**.
- Increase gradually. If a site becomes flaky, throttle down and add a longer delay.
- For huge tab sets, enable **continue from where it left off** to resume later.

### 7) Quick troubleshooting

- Raise **log level** to 1–2 and check the Console for `[Mass image downloader]: …` messages (why an item was skipped, grouping decisions, download outcomes).
- **Filter extension logs quickly** in DevTools:
  1) Open **DevTools → Console** (F12 or Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + I).  
  2) Set the level dropdown to **All levels**.  
  3) In the **Console filter** box (top of the console), type:

      ```text
     [Mass image downloader]
     ```

This shows only messages emitted by the extension.
Optional: enable the **regex** toggle and use:

       ```text
       ^\[Mass image downloader\]
       ```

To match logs that **start** with the prefix.

  1) You can also press **Ctrl/Cmd + F** to find occurrences in the visible output.
  2) Tip: enable **Preserve log** to keep messages across page reloads.
- If results look small, inspect `naturalWidth/Height` in DevTools (CSS can upscale visuals).
- If a platform uses `:large` / `:orig`, enable **Allow extended image URLs**.
- For login-gated pages, keep the session authenticated; try **Web-linked galleries** if direct modes miss items.

## 🧠 Technical design

This section outlines the architecture, core flows, and the responsibilities of each module so contributors can navigate the codebase with confidence.

### Architecture overview

- **Service Worker (MV3)** — `background.js` orchestrates flows, validates environment (Chromium ≥ 93), loads settings, manages downloads, and audits completion.  
- **Content scripts** — `extractLinkedGallery.js` and `extractVisualGallery.js` inspect page DOMs, discover candidates (URLs or `<img>`), and report back to the Service Worker; `imageInspector.js` manages the Image Inspector overlay and side panel on the active page.  
- **UI surfaces** — `popup.html/js` trigger flows and expose entry points; `options.html/js` persist configuration via `chrome.storage.sync`; **Peek** pages offer read-only visibility of the active config.  
- **Utilities** — `utils.js` centralizes URL/format/size validation, deterministic naming, badge/notifications, and small robustness helpers.

### File-by-file map

| File | Role | Key responsibilities | Main APIs / Events |
|---|---|---|---|
| `manifest.json` | MV3 manifest | Declares permissions, host permissions, background SW, action icon, commands | — |
| `background.js` | Orchestrator (Service Worker) | Load settings; version guard; receive messages; enforce deterministic filenames; kick off downloads; audit via `downloads.search`; update badge | `chrome.runtime.*`, `chrome.action.*`, `chrome.downloads.*`, `chrome.tabs.*`, `chrome.storage.*` |
| `utils.js` | Utilities | Validate URL/format/dimensions; normalize paths; build filenames (prefix/suffix/timestamp); badge updates; toasts; defensive helpers | `chrome.action.*`, `chrome.storage.*` |
| `extractLinkedGallery.js` | Gallery extractor (with direct links) | Find anchors to media files; apply rules; group by similarity; send candidates to SW | `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` |
| `extractVisualGallery.js` | Gallery extractor (without direct links) | Collect visible `<img>` that meet thresholds; optional grouping; send candidates to SW | `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` |
| `imageInspector.js` | Image Inspector content script | Manage Inspector Mode lifecycle: toggle overlay via hotkey, handle hover detection, render the right-docked panel (Shadow DOM), provide zoom/pan/navigation, extract metadata, and dispatch save requests to the Service Worker | `chrome.runtime.sendMessage`, `chrome.storage.sync`, DOM events |
| `popup.html` | Popup UI | Entry points to Bulk / Galleries / Web-linked / Settings / Peek | — |
| `popup.js` | Popup logic | Wire UI actions to background flows; open Options/Peek | `chrome.runtime.*`, `chrome.tabs.*` |
| `options.html` | Options UI | Structured settings (Global, Galleries, Size, FS/URL/Naming, Notifications, Debug) | — |
| `options.js` | Options logic | Read/write `chrome.storage.sync`; apply defaults; validate ranges; toggle formats/extended URLs; preset management | `chrome.storage.sync` |
| `clipboardHotkeys.js` | Clipboard hotkeys | Set prefix/suffix from clipboard (P/S) | `clipboardRead`, `chrome.runtime.*` |
| `peekOptions.html` | Peek UI | Read-only settings overlay (transparency configurable) | — |
| `peekOptions.js` | Peek UI logic | Fetch and render current settings; refresh; open/close | `chrome.storage.sync`, `chrome.runtime.*` |
| `settingsPeek.js` | Peek helpers | Format values for display (thresholds, toggles, formats) | `chrome.runtime.*` |
| `README.md` | Documentation | User/developer docs | — |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Release notes | Added / Changed / Fixed / Maintenance | — |

### Downloads pipeline (end-to-end)

1. **Collect** candidates (content scripts or bulk tab scanner).  
2. **Validate** early (format/size/URL; extended URL suffixes if enabled).  
3. **Name** deterministically (prefix/suffix/timestamp; sanitized).  
4. **Download** via `chrome.downloads.download`.  
5. **Enforce** final path with `downloads.onDeterminingFilename`.  
6. **Audit** outcomes using `downloads.search`.  
7. **Signal** progress with the badge (green/yellow/blue).

### Gallery engines (page-structure aware)

- **Direct links:** anchors point to media files → pick optimal target → save.  
- **Without links:** large inline `<img>` → filter by size/format → optional grouping.  
- **Web-linked:** anchors point to HTML pages → open with bounded fan-out → extract best image.

### Similarity & bounding

- **Path similarity threshold** clusters variants and reduces duplicates.  
- **Minimum group size** avoids noise from tiny clusters.  
- **Max images per gallery** prevents a single source from dominating.

### Performance & resilience

- **Max images per second** throttles gallery throughput to avoid rate limits.  
- **Batching** keeps the MV3 Service Worker responsive in bulk flows.  
- **Bounded fan-out** (max open tabs + delay) prevents tab storms in web-linked mode.  
- **Defensive messaging** and guarded listeners handle MV3 lifecycle quirks gracefully.

---

## 👷 Optimizations

Practical techniques used by the extension to stay fast, predictable, and resilient in real sites.

### Throughput & pacing

- **Max images per second** smooths gallery extraction to avoid CPU spikes and site-side throttling.
- **Bounded fan-out** in Web-linked mode (max open tabs + delay between openings) prevents tab storms while keeping good parallelism.
- **Batching** in the “Download images directly in tabs” flow keeps the MV3 Service Worker responsive.

> Start conservative (e.g., 2–3 images/sec, small tab cap, short delay) and ramp up as stability allows.

### Workload bounding

- **Max images per gallery** prevents a single page from dominating a run.
- **Minimum group size** discards tiny, noisy clusters.

> Bounding memory and network upfront is cheaper than downloading then deleting.

### Signal quality (less noise, better results)

- **Gallery similarity level** clusters related variants; fewer duplicates/resized copies get through.
- **Extended image URLs** (optional) accept suffix variants like `:large`, `:orig` when platforms expose higher-res assets.

> Clean grouping first; it reduces wasted work and de-dup effort later.

### I/O reliability

- **Deterministic file naming** (`downloads.onDeterminingFilename`) guarantees stable names/paths (prefix/suffix/timestamp).
- **Post-download auditing** (`downloads.search`) double-checks completion and catches edge cases.

> Deterministic outputs make datasets reproducible and easier to resume mid-run.

### MV3 lifecycle & memory

- Short-lived structures, guarded timers, and minimal retained closures reduce RAM drift.
- Batches and short bursts align with the **sleepy** MV3 Service Worker model.

> Designing for bursty work avoids stalls and zombie listeners.

### Error handling & resilience

- Defensive message passing (content ↔ background) with `try/catch` around transient MV3 `lastError`.
- Safe tab closure de-duplicates requests and avoids churn on success/failure paths.

> Clear failure modes mean faster retries and easier diagnostics.

### Feedback loops

- **Badge colors** (green/yellow/blue) reflect real progress; optional **toasts** reduce guesswork.
- **Console log levels (0–3)** let you dial in the right visibility for normal use vs. debugging.

> Keep logs at 0–1 daily; raise to 2–3 only while investigating.

---

## 🔌 Browser-native APIs

A minimal, well-scoped MV3 surface to stay compatible, performant, and secure.

- **chrome.downloads**  
  - `downloads.download` — trigger file saves with requested filenames/paths.  
  - `downloads.onDeterminingFilename` — enforce deterministic names (prefix/suffix/timestamp) and subpaths.  
  - `downloads.search` — audit completed downloads to confirm outcomes and catch edge cases.  
  Applies to: All modes.

- **chrome.tabs**  
  - Open background tabs for **Web-linked** extraction; orchestrate multi-tab scans.  
  - Read tab state and coordinate safe cleanup.  
  Applies to: Bulk flow and Web-linked galleries.

- **chrome.action**  
  - Update the toolbar badge (text/color) to reflect progress: green (bulk), yellow (manual), blue (done).  
  Applies to: All modes.

- **chrome.runtime**  
  - Message bus between content scripts and the Service Worker.  
  - Handle lifecycle events and transient `lastError`.  
  Applies to: All modes.

- **chrome.storage.sync**  
  - Persist options (formats, thresholds, naming, pacing) across sessions and UIs.  
  - Source of truth for **Peek**.  
  Applies to: All modes.

- **chrome.scripting**  
  - Controlled content injection where needed under MV3 constraints.  
  Applies to: Content-side helpers.

- **clipboardRead (permission)**  
  - Enable clipboard-based hotkeys to set filename prefix/suffix.  
  Applies to: Manual/labeling workflows.

**Notes:**  

- Host permissions are broad to enable discovery, but logic rejects non-media endpoints and HTML in the wrong flow.  
- Message passing and critical listeners are wrapped defensively to avoid leaks under MV3’s sleep/wake lifecycle.

## 🎛 Runtime Flexibility

Adapt behavior to the site, your machine, and your workflow—without touching code.

### Formats & URL rules

- **Allowed formats:** PNG, JPG, JPEG, WEBP, AVIF, BMP (toggles per format).  
  Applies to: All modes.  
  **Notes:** Disabling unused formats speeds validation. AVIF/BMP require browser support.

- **Allow extended image URLs:** accept suffix variants like `:large`, `:orig` (Twitter/X, Pixiv).  
  Applies to: All modes.  
  **Notes:** Doesn’t upscale; only recognizes valid high-res variants when platforms provide them.

### Size filters

- **Minimum width / height:** both must be met to qualify.  
  Applies to: All modes.  
  **Notes:** If expected images are skipped, check `naturalWidth/Height` in DevTools—CSS can scale visuals.

### Gallery shaping

- **Gallery similarity level (%):** clusters near-duplicates by path likeness.  
  Applies to: Gallery extractors.  
  **Notes:** Raise to group more aggressively; lower if legitimate variants get split.

- **Minimum group size:** ignores tiny/noisy clusters.  
  Applies to: Gallery extractors.

### Pacing & stability

- **Max images per second:** smooths gallery extraction to avoid rate limits and CPU spikes.  
  Applies to: Gallery extractors.  
  **Notes:** Start at 2–3; increase gradually.

- **Max open tabs per gallery / Delay between openings (ms):** bounds fan-out in Web-linked mode.  
  Applies to: Web-linked galleries.  
  **Notes:** Prevents tab storms; add delay for stricter sites.

- **Max images per batch / Continue from where it left off:** keeps bulk tab runs predictable and resumable.  
  Applies to: Download images directly in tabs.

### Naming & labeling

- **Filename mode:** none / prefix / suffix / both / timestamp.  
  Applies to: All modes.  
  **Notes:** Prefix/suffix for labeled datasets; timestamp to avoid collisions.

- **Clipboard hotkeys (P/S):** copy once, label the whole batch.  
  Applies to: Naming only.  
  **Notes:** `Ctrl+Alt+P` (Prefix), `Ctrl+Alt+S` (Suffix).

### Feedback & diagnostics

- **Badge colors:** green (bulk), yellow (manual), blue (done).  
  Applies to: All modes.

- **Toasts & log level (0–3):** tune visibility vs. overhead.  
  Applies to: All modes.  
  **Notes:** Keep logs at 0–1 daily; raise to 2–3 for troubleshooting (filter in Console by typing `[Mass image downloader]`).

## 🔧 Recommended setup

Pick a starting profile that matches your machine and the strictness of target sites. You can always tune individual options afterward (or apply a **Performance Preset** from Options).

| Profile | Max images/sec (galleries) | Max open tabs per gallery | Delay between openings (ms) | Max images per batch (bulk tabs) | Gallery similarity level | Log level | Toasts | Typical use |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| **Low (lightweight / strict sites)** | 2 | 3–4 | 600–1000 | 10–15 | 85–90% | 1 | On | Older hardware, metered networks, or sites with aggressive throttling |
| **Medium (default)** | 3–5 | 5–6 | 300–800 | 20–30 | 75–85% | 1 | On | General browsing, forums, image boards, typical galleries |
| **High (powerful / local testing)** | 6–10 | 7–10 | 150–400 | 40–60 | 65–75% | 0–1 | Off | Fast machines, stable sites, short sessions where you can monitor |

### Notes

- Start conservative and **increase gradually**. If failures or rate limits appear, reduce **Max images/sec** and/or increase **Delay**.
- High similarity levels (e.g., 85–90%) group more aggressively (fewer duplicates) but can split legitimate variants on messy sites. Lower it on heterogeneous galleries.
- For very large tab sets, keep **Max images per batch** moderate and enable **Continue from where it left off** to resume later without rework.
- If you’re curating manually, enable the **One-click download icon** and use **Alt+Shift+I**, plus clipboard hotkeys (`Ctrl+Alt+P` / `Ctrl+Alt+S`) for consistent labeling.

## 🧪 Advanced / Developer tips

Legend: Practical guidance for diagnostics, testing, and contributions. Use these workflows to understand why items are skipped, validate pacing/grouping, and collect solid evidence for issues or PRs.

### View live flow details

- Open **DevTools → Console** (F12 or Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + I) and set **log level** to 1–3 in Options.
- Filter extension logs quickly:
  1) Set the Console level dropdown to **All levels**.  
  2) In the **Console filter** box, type:

     ```text
     [Mass image downloader]
     ```

     Optional (regex on):

     ```text
     ^\[Mass image downloader\]
     
- Example messages:

```text
[Mass image downloader]: ✅ accepted URL https://.../full.jpg (800x1200, jpg)
[Mass image downloader]: ⏩ grouped 6 candidates under /gallery/2025/...
[Mass image downloader]: ⛔ skipped (too small) 240x240 < min 300x500
[Mass image downloader]: ⛔ skipped (format not allowed) avif
[Mass image downloader]: 💤 throttling (max 3 img/s), scheduling next batch...
```

#### Logging for Image Inspector Mode (🕵️)

Image Inspector runs as a content script, so its logs appear in the **page’s DevTools**, not in the Service Worker console.

To view inspector-specific activity:

1) Open **DevTools → Console** on the page you are inspecting  
   (right-click the page → “Inspect” or press **Ctrl+Shift+I**).

2) Ensure the Console level is set to **3**.

3) Filter logs by typing:

    ```text
     [Mass image downloader]
     ```

4) Look for messages related to inspector lifecycle:

- Overlay activation/deactivation  
- Hover detection  
- Panel attach/detach  
- Zoom/pan state  
- Metadata resolution  
- Save dispatch to the background worker  

These messages help verify why an image was accepted or rejected, confirm event flow correctness, and diagnose issues with panel behavior.

### Test image thresholds (quick sanity check)

- Inspect a candidate image in DevTools Elements panel and check:
- `naturalWidth`, `naturalHeight`
- Tune **Minimum width/height** until your intended items are accepted and small assets are filtered out.
- If visuals look large but are rejected, CSS may be upscaling; rely on *natural* dimensions.

### Simulate extraction failures (for diagnosis)

- Temporarily **raise** min dimensions or **disable** a format to force predictable skips.
- Watch Console (log level 1–2) to confirm skip reasons (size/format/URL).
- Restore normal values after validating behavior.

### Reproduce issues reliably

- Prefer the **unpacked** build (Developer Mode).
- Start small: a single page or a tiny gallery; then scale throughput (images/sec) gradually.
- Capture:
- Page URL(s) and the chosen **mode** (Bulk / Galleries with/without links / Web-linked).
- **Options** snapshot (use **Peek Settings**).
- Console excerpts (log level 1–2) showing the failure or skip reason.

### Stable Service Worker (MV3) habits

- Keep **runs short** (batching) to avoid long-lived workers.
- Avoid closing tabs opened by Web-linked mode until the badge turns **blue**.
- If a site is strict, reduce **Max images per second**, add **Delay between tab openings**, and limit **Max open tabs per gallery**.

### Logging levels (0–3)

| Level | Purpose | Typical use |
|---:|---|---|
| 0 | Silent | Day-to-day usage with minimal overhead |
| 1 | Basic flow | Recommended default; milestones and high-level skip reasons |
| 2 | Verbose | Diagnostics; warnings and more detailed state transitions |
| 3 | Detailed | Deep debugging; full traces around grouping, filtering, downloads |

## ⌨️ Extension Shortcuts & Commands

Keyboard shortcuts speed up labeling and manual saves. If a shortcut conflicts with your OS or other apps, you can remap it in browser/OS settings.

| Shortcut | Action | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Alt + Shift + D** | Bulk Image Download | Scans open tabs and downloads valid image targets |
| **Alt + Shift + G** | Extract galleries (direct links) | Best for galleries where thumbnails point directly to image files |
| **Alt + Shift + V** | Extract galleries (visual / no links) | Best for inline image galleries without dedicated anchors |
| **Alt + Shift + W** | Extract galleries (web-linked) | Opens linked detail pages and processes them as gallery candidates |
| **Alt + Shift + S** | Toggle Settings Peek | Opens the read-only configuration overlay |
| **Alt + Shift + I** | Toggle the one-click download icon | Manual curation flow for quick image saving |
| **Ctrl + Shift + M** | Toggle Image Inspector Mode | Opens the inspector workflow |
| **Ctrl + Alt + P** | Set filename prefix from clipboard | Requires clipboard hotkeys enabled |
| **Ctrl + Alt + S** | Set filename suffix from clipboard | Requires clipboard hotkeys enabled |

### Tips

- Copy a label once (e.g., “datasetA”) and press **Ctrl+Alt+P** to apply it as a prefix for the whole batch (result: “datasetA_”).
- Use **Alt+Shift+I** to cherry-pick an image from a page without opening the popup.
- Use **Ctrl+Shift+M** when you need to inspect a single image in depth—check dimensions, alt/title, and URL variants before saving, all without leaving the current tab.

> Debugging tip: To inspect Image Inspector logs (hover detection, overlay events, panel lifecycle, metadata resolution, save dispatch), open **DevTools → Console** on the current page and filter messages by `[Mass image downloader]`. Inspector logs appear in the page context, not in the background worker.

---

## 👁️ Peek Settings Mode

A read-only overlay that shows your **active configuration** at a glance—perfect before long runs or when reporting issues.

**Purpose**  
Confirm exactly which thresholds, formats, and pacing rules are in effect without leaving the page you’re analyzing.

**How to open**  

- From the extension **popup**, click **Peek** (or the corresponding link/button in the UI).

**What you’ll see**  

- **Allowed formats**: PNG, JPG, JPEG, WEBP, AVIF, BMP  
- **Allow extended image URLs**: on/off (e.g., `:large`, `:orig`)  
- **Image size**: Minimum width & height (both must be met)  
- **Galleries**: Similarity level (%), Minimum group size, Smart/Fallback grouping  
- **Handling**: Gallery Image Handling (Immediate / Open in new tab)  
- **Throughput**: Max images per second  
- **Web-linked**: Max open tabs per gallery, Delay between openings (ms)  
- **Bulk tabs**: Max images per batch, Continue from where it left off  
- **Naming**: Filename mode (none/prefix/suffix/both/timestamp), current Prefix/Suffix  
- **UI & logs**: Show user feedback messages, Console log level (0–3)  
- **Peek panel transparency**: current opacity (0.2–1.0)

**Notes**  

- Peek is **read-only**. Change values in **Options**, then reopen Peek to verify.  
- Use higher **Console log level** (1–2) when taking screenshots of Peek for bug reports or PRs.  
- Adjust **Peek panel transparency** in Options to keep the page visible underneath while you audit settings.

1. Open console (`Ctrl+Shift+I`) to see detailed logs.
2. Adjust debug level (0–3) from Options.
3. Prefix/suffix via clipboard helps batch renaming.
4. Use fallback logic when galleries are irregular.
5. Grouping uses path similarity (%) → tweak it from the Options page as needed.

## ⚠️ Edge cases & warnings

Situations and caveats that can affect extraction/downloading. Review this list when results don’t match expectations or before filing a bug.

- **Login-gated / paywalled content**  
  Background downloads may fail or return placeholders; keep the session authenticated and retry.

- **Lazy-loaded / infinite scroll galleries**  
  Ensure the page has loaded enough content before extraction; scroll if needed.

- **Cross-origin iframes**  
  Images inside third-party iframes can be invisible to content scripts.

- **Dynamic blobs / data URIs**  
  Only network-reachable images are downloadable; if direct extraction yields few results, try **Web-linked galleries**.

- **Extended URL suffixes**  
  `:large`, `:orig` work only when **Allow extended image URLs** is enabled and the platform supports them.

- **Minimum size filters**  
  Both width and height must meet thresholds; CSS scaling can be misleading—check real pixel sizes in DevTools.

- **Format toggles**  
  AVIF/BMP depend on browser support; if candidates are skipped, verify decoding support and toggles.

- **Rate limits / transient blocks**  
  Lower **Max images per second** on strict sites; add **Delay between tab openings (ms)** and reduce **Max open tabs per gallery**.

- **File naming collisions**  
  Deterministic naming reduces conflicts; external renamers or OS locks can delay writes—badge turns **blue** only after completion.

- **MV3 lifecycle**  
  The Service Worker sleeps between events; long runs are split into batches by design.

- **Non-standard markup**  
  If direct/visual modes miss items, try **Web-linked galleries** as an alternative.

- **Image Inspector overlay placement**  
  Responsive layouts (e.g., `<figure>` wrappers or full-viewport images) can affect where the 🕵️ overlay appears. In some edge cases the overlay may need a hover retry or minor scroll adjustment for ideal positioning.

- **InspectorOverlayOffset (edge case)**  
  On certain pages that use complex responsive wrappers (nested `<figure>` blocks, aspect-ratio containers, or captioned layouts), the 🕵️ overlay may appear slightly offset relative to the true top-right corner of the image.  
  This is a visual-only condition: hover detection, click handling, and Inspector workflows remain fully functional.  
  The condition is documented and scheduled for a future refinement alongside existing Inspector edge cases (`NestedFigureResponsiveImg`, `DirectImageOverlayPosition`).

- **Inspector metadata redaction**  
  For security and privacy reasons, the inspector hides local/blob/data URLs in its metadata view. The underlying validation and download pipeline can still operate on them when permitted, but raw values are not exposed in the panel.  

- **Prefix/Suffix persistence (clipboard hotkeys)**  
  Clipboard-based naming (Ctrl+Alt+P / Ctrl+Alt+S) persists across flows, but in some MV3 lifecycle conditions the extension may revert to the last stored values in `chrome.storage.sync`.  
  If a naming label appears to be “missing” after a long idle period, simply open **Peek Settings** once — this refreshes the in-memory configuration and restores the active prefix/suffix for subsequent downloads.  
  This behavior is benign and tied to MV3’s transient worker model; your saved values are never lost.

   - `feature/<short-name>` for features  
   - `bugfix/<short-name>` for fixes  
   - `docs/<short-name>` for documentation updates
2) **Develop & test** locally (unpacked build)  
   - Load via `chrome://extensions` → **Developer Mode** → **Load unpacked**  
   - Reproduce scenarios: Bulk / Galleries (with/without links) / Web-linked  
   - Use **Debug log level 1–2** and **Peek Settings** to capture evidence
3) **Coding standards**  
   - MV3-compatible JavaScript; defensive `try/catch` around async/message edges  
   - Console logs **prefixed** with: `[Mass image downloader]: <emoji> <message>` (use function logDebug in utils.js)  
   - Comments in **English**, concise and actionable  
   - Shared helpers live in `utils.js`  
   - Keep UI copy consistent with existing style
4) **PR checklist**  
   - Update **CHANGELOG.md** (Added / Changed / Fixed / Maintenance), if applicable  
   - Update **README.md** when behavior, options, or requirements change  
   - Bump `manifest.json` version if warranted  
   - Include reproducible steps (URL pattern, chosen mode, expected vs. actual)  
   - Attach Console excerpts (log level 1–2) and, if possible, short clips for UI changes
5) **Open the PR**  
   - Target branch: **`dev`**  
   - Link related issues, describe scope, edge cases, and trade-offs  
   - Prefer small, focused PRs for faster review and merge

### Quick path to a solid PR

> 1) **Fork** and branch off **`dev`** (`feature/<name>` or `bugfix/<name>`).  
> 2) **Reproduce** the problem with a minimal, deterministic scenario (URL pattern, steps, expected vs. actual).  
> 3) **Implement** the fix following project style: JS-only (MV3), defensive errors, logs prefixed with `[Mass image downloader]:`.  
> 4) **Verify** locally (unpacked) with Debug log **level 1–2**; attach before/after Console snippets.  
> 5) **Update** docs if behavior/options change, and add a concise entry in **CHANGELOG.md**.  
> 6) **Open the PR**, link issues, and note any edge cases considered.

## 📝 Changelog

See the full release notes in **[CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md)**.  
Current version: **v2.08.179**.

---

## 🔒 Privacy

This extension runs **locally** in your browser. It does **not** send browsing data or downloaded images to external servers, does **not** include telemetry or tracking, and stores configuration in **`chrome.storage.sync`**.  No data is collected or transmitted.

Requested permissions are limited to the features described in this README (tabs, downloads, storage, scripting, clipboardRead).  
Host permissions (`<all_urls>`) are required to discover and validate images across sites; filtering happens client-side.

### Notes

- Some formats (e.g., AVIF) depend on your browser/OS; no external decoder services are used.  
- The optional **Peek** overlay is read-only and displays locally stored settings only.

## 📜 Usage Policy

This project is offered for legitimate, responsible use. By using it, you agree to:

- **Respect site terms** — Follow the target website’s Terms of Service and applicable laws (including copyright).  
- **Be gentle with servers** — Use pacing controls (Max images per second, Max open tabs per gallery, Delay between openings) to avoid undue load.  
- **Handle personal data carefully** — If pages contain personal or sensitive images, ensure you have a lawful basis to download and store them.  
- **Own your outputs** — You are responsible for how you use downloaded content and for complying with any licensing or attribution requirements.  
- **No warranty** — The software is provided “as is” under the MPL-2.0 license; the authors are not liable for misuse or resulting damages.

### Good citizen tips

- Start with conservative throughput and increase gradually.  
- Prefer “Open in new tab before downloading” when you need visual confirmation or when sites render the final image via client-side scripts.  
- Use deterministic naming (prefix/suffix/timestamp) to keep datasets auditable and reproducible.
