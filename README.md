Mass Image Downloader
Mass Image Downloader is a browser extension designed to automate the process of downloading images directly from open tabs. It provides a seamless experience for users who need to bulk download images without interruptions.

Features
- Automatic Image Download: Detects and downloads images from active tabs.
- Batch Processing: Supports simultaneous downloads with user-defined limits.
- Customizable Save Location: Allows users to save images in the default system folder or a custom directory.
- Tab Navigation: Skips non-image tabs and processes images efficiently.
- Minimal User Interaction: Images are saved automatically without confirmation pop-ups.
- Badge Counter: Displays the number of images downloaded in real-time.

How It Works
- Click on the extension icon to open the popup.
- Press the "Download to Right" button.
- The extension starts processing from the active tab and moves rightward.
- Images are downloaded and their respective tabs are closed upon success.
- The counter updates dynamically to show progress.

Settings & Configuration
- Navigate to Settings from the popup to customize preferences.
- Download Folder:
Default System Folder: Saves images in the system's default downloads directory.
Custom Folder: Users can specify a subdirectory within the default folder.
- Max Simultaneous Downloads:
Users can set a limit between 1 and 4 concurrent downloads.

Restrictions
- The extension only operates when the URL of a tab is a direct image (e.g., .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .webp).
- If a tab is still loading, it is skipped to prevent performance issues.
- If the browser’s "Ask where to save each file before downloading" option is enabled, the extension will not function properly.

Known Issues
- Some websites may block automatic downloads due to security policies.
- Large batches of images may cause a brief performance slowdown.

Future Enhancements
- Enhanced filtering to exclude specific image dimensions or file types.
