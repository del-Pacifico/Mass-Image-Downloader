        🤔 Edge Case Report

        Use this template to document **non-blocking, context-dependent behaviors**
        that occur only under specific conditions (DOM structure, responsive layouts,
        scroll containers, CSS transforms, zoom level, or MV3 lifecycle timing).

        ✅ Use this for:
        - Visual quirks or minor UX degradations
        - Behavior reproducible only under specific page or layout conditions
        - Known limitations that do NOT break core flows

        ❌ Do NOT use this for:
        - Crashes, runtime errors, or broken core flows
        - Download failures or blockers
        - Regressions that used to work

        If the issue blocks downloads or breaks a core flow, use **Bug Report** instead.

        Tips:
        - Keep the report objective and reproducible.
        - Prefer minimal steps that work on a fresh browser profile.
        - Avoid proposing full solutions; use Technical Notes only for short hypotheses.

        One concise sentence describing WHAT happens + UNDER WHICH CONDITION.
        Avoid causes or solutions here.
        Example: "Overlay appears offset on full-viewport images at non-100% zoom."

      description: >
        Describe the specific layout, DOM structure, browser state, or conditions
        required for this edge case to appear.
        Think in terms of wrappers, viewport size, transforms, scroll containers, zoom.
      placeholder: |
        - Page layout / DOM structure:
        - Responsive wrappers (<figure>, <picture>, srcset, etc.):
        - Scroll containers or CSS transforms:
        - Zoom level / viewport size:

      label: Steps to Reproduce
      description: >
        Provide minimal, deterministic steps. A reviewer should be able to reproduce
        this on a fresh browser profile. Include zoom level and scrolling if relevant.
      placeholder: |
        1) Open the page (include any required navigation)
        2) Set zoom level (if relevant): 100% / 110% / 90%
        3) Enable the feature (include hotkey if used)
        4) Perform the interaction (hover / click / scroll)
        5) Observe the behavior and note what differs from expectations

      description: >
        Choose the lowest accurate impact level:
        - Visual only: cosmetic/UI alignment, workflows still work
        - Minor UX degradation: extra interaction needed, but feature remains usable
        - Functional limitation: feature works only in certain contexts/pages
      options:
        - Visual only (no functional impact)
        - Minor UX degradation
        - Functional limitation in specific contexts

        Optional. Record observations or short hypotheses. Avoid full solutions.
        Include any useful signals (target element type, rect values, scroll container, zoom).
      placeholder: |
        - Observed on: <figure>/<picture>/srcset or full-viewport image
        - Might involve: boundingClientRect vs visual bounds under wrappers/transforms
        - Relevant signals: scroll container, CSS transform, zoom level, viewport size
