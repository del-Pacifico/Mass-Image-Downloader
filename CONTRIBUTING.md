## 🤖 AI-Assisted Contributions 

This project partially uses tools based on artificial intelligence (AI) for assistance, such as: 

- Copilot 
- ChatGPT 
- Gemini

AI tools may assist in code generation, documentation, formatting, or security best practices. 
However, **all contributions are reviewed manually** to ensure clarity, accuracy, performance, and compliance with the project's standards.

We support responsible and transparent use of AI to accelerate development, without compromising quality or authorship clarity.
